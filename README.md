## 1.Problem
You are asked to implement a grade book to keep track student grades for several couses that a professor teaches. Courses should have the information of department, course number, course name, semester, and year.  For each course, the grade is caculated on various categories, including course participations, homework, tests, projects, etc.  The total percentages of the categories should add to 100% and the total perfect grade should be 100. The number of assignments from each category is unspecified, and can change at any time.  For example, a course may be graded by the distribution: 10% participation, 20% homework, 50% tests, 20% projects. Please note that if there are 5 homework, each homework is worth 20%/5=4% of the grade.
